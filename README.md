# RISC-V-Single-cycle-processor
This repository contains an implementation of a RISC-V single-cycle processor, designed to execute a subset of the RISC-V ISA (RV32I). The processor follows a single-cycle architecture, meaning each instruction completes in one clock cycle.

ðŸ›‘Features:

âœ… Implements core RV32I instructions.

âœ… Single-cycle datapath and control logic.

âœ… Written in Verilog.

âœ… Simple and easy-to-understand design for educational use.

âœ… Testbench and example programs included.

This project is ideal for learning about processor design, RISC-V architecture, and digital logic implementation.
